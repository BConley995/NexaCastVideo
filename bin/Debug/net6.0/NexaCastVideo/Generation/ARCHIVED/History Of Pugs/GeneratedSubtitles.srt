Narrator: So, what led to the rise of the pug in ancient China? Well, pugs were highly revered and cherished by Chinese emperors and aristocrats. They were considered sacred and were even given their own luxury accommodations within the palaces. The emperors believed that these small, loyal canines brought good fortune and had the power to ward off evil spirits.
