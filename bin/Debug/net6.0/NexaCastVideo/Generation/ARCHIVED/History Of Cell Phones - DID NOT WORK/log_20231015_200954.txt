[Animated footage of the first-ever cell phones appears on screen]

Host: "First, letHost: "First, let's talk about the early days of cell phones. Believe it or not, cell phones did not always fit in our pockets or have touchscreens.

Apple's introduction of the iPhone completely transformed the industry. With its sleek design, multitouch display, and intuitive user interface, the iPhone set a new standard for smartphones."
