that during Samhain, the boundary between the living and the dead became blurred, allowing for communication and interaction between the two realms. To honor this occasion, the Celts would dress in costumes made from animal hides and masks to ward off evil spirits."

and other offerings outside their homes. This practice, known as "souling," involved wearing costumes and going from door to door, singing songs or reciting prayers in exchange for food, called "soul cakes." It was believed that by participating in souling, the living could help ease the spirits' passage to the afterlife."

Host: "As Christianity spread throughout the Celtic lands, the Church aimed to replace the pagan traditions with their own. In the 9th century, the Church introduced All Hallows' Day, also known as All Saints' Day, on November 1st. This day was meant to honor all Christian saints and martyrs. To align with this new Christian holiday, the existing Celtic festival of Samhain was moved to the night before, October 31st, and came to be known as

Host: "In summary, trick or treating has its origins in the ancient Celtic festival of Samhain, where costumes and offerings were used to appease spirits. The practice of souling, where people went door to door for food in exchange for songs or prayers, further evolved this tradition. With the influence of Christianity, Samhain was moved to October 31st and became known as Halloween. Today, trick or treating has become a cherished Halloween tradition in many countries, where children dress up
