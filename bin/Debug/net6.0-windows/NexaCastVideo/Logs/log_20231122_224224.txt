Absolutely, here's an interesting fact that could serve as an engaging hook for an educational YouTube video on the history of cyber security

"Did you know that the concept of cyber security dates back to the 1970s, with the creation of a program called 'Creeper'? Developed by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971, Creeper is considered one of the first computer viruses ever. It was an experimental, self-replicating program that infected DEC PDP-10machines running the TENEX operating system, and it spread across computer networks in the early 1970s. Known as the Creeper virus, it was one of the first known computer viruses to have appeared in the wild and was famously followed by

Cybersecurity has evolved over the decades as technology and connected systems have become a more integral part of our lives. Here's an interesting fact from the history of cybersecurity

The term "computer virus" was not coined until 1983, but one of the earliest known examples of a computer virus in action dates back to 1971.
