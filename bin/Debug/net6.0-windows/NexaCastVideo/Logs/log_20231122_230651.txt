"Welcome back to our Cyber Chronicles series – where the past and the future of digital defenses unfold. Today's episode turns back the hands of time to unlock the evolution of anordinary object that we might take for granted, the humble pencil. From its ancient ancestors to the modern mechanical marvels that fill our pencil cases, we'll sketch out the journey of how a simple instrument has redrawn the lines of history and continued to


The history of cyber security dates back to the 1970s with the creation of a computer program called Creeper, which is often cited as the first computer virus. Created by Bob Thomas at BBN Technologies in 1971, Creeper was designed as an experiment to test the concept of a mobile application. Rather than being malicious, it was an inoffensive program that simply displayed the message, "I'm the creeper, catch me if you can!" on the screens of the DECPDP-10 computers at MIT's Project MAC. It is widely considered one of the first examples of a self-replicating program, often referred to as a computer worm.

One notable event in the history of cyber security is the creation of the Morris Worm in 1988, which is considered to be the first computer worm on the internet. Robert Tappan Morris, then a graduate student at Cornell University, wrote the worm to gauge the size of the internet. 

The Morris Worm was intended to be harmless; it would infect UNIX systems, determine if they were already infected, and then replicate itself. Unfortunately, due to a programming error, the worm infected systems multipletimes, leading to widespread disruptions as it repeatedly copied itself onto networked machines, consuming valuable system resources and causing significant slowdowns. This event highlighted the importance of robust cybersecurity measures and the need for constant vigilance in the digital age. Thank you for watching NexaCast.
